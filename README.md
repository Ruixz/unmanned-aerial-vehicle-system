unmanned-aerial-vehicle-system
==============================

Final project from Data structure and Algorithms in 2014 Spring.

Requirement:

The objective of the final project is to learn how to develop algorithms for intelligent, autonomous and self-organizing agents. In addition, you will learn how to use the power of graph theory to model intelligence as software algorithms. 

You are to build software tools to simulate unmanned aerial vehicle systems. The system operates with human intervention, makes choices, dealing with unexpected situations, satisfying predefined constraints while seeking specific target objectives. You must decide on a specific application among many. Key options include delivery of medication and blood products in disaster recovery situations, vaccine transport to remote areas, etc.

The system will include an engine, flight control, compass, GPS, and possibly google maps. The system will be configured by an operator to follow a predefined flight plan which must incorporate anticipated to changes to weather conditions and so on. 

A solid graphical user interface with control panels and monitoring capabilities is a must. 

For your to receive any meaningful grade on the project, your solution must have creative ideas that are unique to your solution. Vanilla solutions will not be accepted.
